## Implementation Steps Taken Part 1

1. Read a csv file (hard code the filename), line by line and print question (column 1) & answer (column 2)
2. Prompt the user for a file name when executing the program. Use the answer as the filename to read and print all questions & answers just like step 1.
3. Prompt the user for an answer and only print 1 question at the time. Show some success/error message after the user has answered.
4. Remove success/error message after each question & implement correct response tracker instead. Display it at the end of the quiz.

## Implementation Steps Taken Part 2

## Launch program

1. `cd` into the `quiz` folder
2. `go run main.go`
3. Answer the questions using your keyboard
